# Sibling_Program_Algorithm
Each year, the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy (IMSA) Student Council runs a Sibling Program where underclassmen are matched with
upperclassmen to foster close connections between students and help underclassmen adjust to the new school environment. In previous years,
Student Council matched students randomly, leading to sibling pairs who shared very little in common, and as a result, quickly grew
apart. To solve this issue, the IMSA Student Council collects data from students about preferences they have for their big/little sibling.
To help sift through the data, I developed the algorithm in this repository which determines sibling pairs who have the highest degree of
compatibility.
